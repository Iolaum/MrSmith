## Trading Agent Competition - Ad eXchange (TAC - AdX)

Repository for the development and testing of agent named MrSmith to take part in an TAC-AdX game simulating competitive online advertising. The agent represents an Advertising Network bidding for Campign Adds, User classification services and Impression (to display ads) simulating the environment of actual Ad Networks.



### Notes:

1. [TAC - AdX site](https://sites.google.com/site/gameadx/)
2. Java 7 suggested (for the server version we used) because some server functions use Java features that have been discontinued on later versions due to security vulnerabilities.
